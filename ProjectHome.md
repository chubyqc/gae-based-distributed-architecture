This project's goal is to develop an architecture based on GAE that will enable someone to invoke the execution of a task from, let's say, a web-enabled hand-held device on his home computer. The base use-case will be to launch a torrent download from an Ipod on a home computer through Internet.

The architecture will have to make it easy for developers to create executable tasks that have both a web front-end for execution triggering and a client that actually execute something on the home desktop machine.

It will also have to integrate a good security system in order to avoid any security breach that could allow someone to harm the machine where the client is hosted.
